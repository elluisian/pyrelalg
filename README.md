# pyrelalg

During my study of Database design, I had some troubles with relational algebra.\
I tried some tools but they did not satisfy me, so I decided to write this very simple library (if it can be called that) in order to debug the relational algebra expressions I needed.

This "library" is provided as-is, without any warranty, the code might need some more polish, I'll see if I can improve it in the future.


## How to use

Please, check the "various-tests/exercise-example.py" file in order to see a sample program.
